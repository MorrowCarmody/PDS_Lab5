INSTRUCTIONS:
Take a string and returns True if it is a palindrome and False otherwise. Use a stack (simulated
with a list as we did in Section 5.11) to help determine whether a string is a palindrome. Your function
should ignore case sensitivity (that is, 'a' and 'A' are the same), spaces and punctuations.
